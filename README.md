# Bullshit-Downloader
> I came across a website that contains all of the episodes for the TV show *[Penn & Teller: Bullshit.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346369/)* I decided that instead of downloading each episode one by one I would write a Python script to do it for me. Using selenium and BeautifulSoup, this is the solution I came up with. 


## Clone
- Clone repo to your local machine using `https://github.com/BryanBorge/bullshit-downloader.git`

## Installation and Setup
- Repo contains all code required to get started

> Install BeautifulSoup 
````shell
pip install BeautifulSoup4
````
