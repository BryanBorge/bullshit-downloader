# bullshit-downloader
I came across this website that contains all of the episodes for the TV show *[Penn & Teller: Bullshit.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346369/)* I decided that instead of downloading each episode one by one I would write a Python script to do it for me. Using selenium and BeautifulSoup, this is the solution I came up with.
